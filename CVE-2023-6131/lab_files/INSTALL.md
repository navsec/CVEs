Run the following to spin up all necessary containers via docker compose
    `docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate`

This will create the following containers
    debian --> Attacker box
    suitecrm --> Server that hosts the SuiteCRM application
    mariadb --> Database for SuiteCRM

When all containers are alive navigate to `localhost:9000/suitecrm/install.php` and install the application
    - Use `root:password` for database connection and use hostname `mariadb`
    - Use `admin:password` for suitecrm admin user setup
    - Use any arbitrary email at @local.local - ex: iiowdajoiawjiojwaoia@local.local
    - Click Next

One all setup we will likely see an error - this is fine, navigate out of the installer and to the main page by going to
`http://localhost:9000/suitecrm/index.php`
